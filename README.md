# The CAFE downstream analysis and MHC coordinates analysis scripts
This repository contains custom scripts to analyse the CAFE gene gain and losses results and MHC coordinates blast results in R.
These scripts have been used in paper "Adaptive signatures of river buffalo in protein degradation, olfactory receptor, detoxification and immune system".

## CAFE downstream analysis
Three proesses have been done for the output of CAFE:
1. Testing the different models in CAFE, and comfirm the best model to use.
2. Inporting the CAFE results to do the GO, KEGG and Reactome enrichment analysis.
3. Finding and test the branch specific p-values for river buffalo.

## MHC coordinates analysis
This script inpoted the blast results between Babesia ovata and other six species.
Calculate and visualize the blast hit over the genes for each species.
Also, the results have been compared to the manual curation for MHC gene family.
